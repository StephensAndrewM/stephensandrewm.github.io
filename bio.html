			<p>I'm a full-time student at Tufts University, studying Computer Science. I find technology very intuitive, and I always enjoy learning something new. I have an eye for detail, which is also my way of saying I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I love any project that lets me think logically or creatively. Through the years I have acquired a rather unique skill set by having more hobbies than any one person can seemingly have time for, but I've never let time hold me back.</p>
